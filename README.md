# Pig Latin
This is a webpage that transforms the users inputted word into some sort of "Latin" word.

## About
The project is basically a study of getting the concept of a BDD skills(Behavior Driven Development).

The specs for the program logic are:
1. For words beginning with a vowel, add "ay" to the end.

1. For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".

1. If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!

1. For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.
